abstract="Paper presents the most important problems connected with Jiles-Atherton model of magnetic B(H) hysteresis. These problems are mainly caused by accuracy of numerical integration as well as methods of solving the ordinary differential equations. Paper presents comparison of accuracy of calculation with MATLAB and OCTAVE for both Windows 7 and Scientific Linux 6.3. Moreover, the analyse of time efficiency is presented. On the base of numerical errors analyses and benchmarking, the guidelines for calculation of Jiles-Atherton model are given.",
